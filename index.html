<!--Intro-->
<p>Hello visitors, my name is Robert Morales. I created this site to display my
work throughout my first year in art school. I am pursing my degree in Computer
Graphics and Animation. As you scroll down you will get to see some of my most
recent work this year. I hope you enjoy! </p>

<!--Portrait-->
<img src="portraits.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" img class="center"><br>
<p>My first objective this semester was to create a portrait using Adobe
  Illustrator. Before I started the portrait project, I had an idea about the
  type of portrait I wanted to create but I had no prior experience with the
  program. Once I became familiar with the interface, I noticed many of the
  tools were like Photoshop which was a relief. I continued work on the
  portrait, choosing a selfie I had taken at a week or so prior. I chose this
  selfie because it represents me. I am always thinking. Whether it is about
  school, family or life, my mind seems to always race.  </p><br>


<!--Audio-->

<p>Leading up to the audio project, we learned how to use Audacity in class.
  I had a chance to use this program prior, so I was able to pick up the new
  tools quickly. I really enjoyed this project because it allowed recreate a
  location using only sounds. When I was young, I remember watching movies and
  trying to listen to all the sounds they used to create complex scenes. The
  sound selection was everything. For my project, I used sounds from the NYC
  train, sounds of kids playing, trees rustling and more. It was interesting,
  gaining an understanding of how important sound is and the role it plays
  on seeing the bigger picture. </p>

<!--Animation-->

<p>For the animation project, I instructed to create an animation using basic
  shapes and sounds. To do this, I was to use Adobe After Effects. Once I
  learned the proper importing, exporting and keyframing techniques to create my
  project, I began to work. Formulating an idea was difficult at first. I spent
  days at work wondering what I would create. Then I remembered to think of
  something that I could relate to. My animation was created as a reminder to
  slow down. Although things seem chaotic now, it will all work out in the
  soon. Just stay calm and smile.  </p><br>


<!--Webdesign Project-->
<a href="https://robertm118.github.io/Adventure_Web/"><img src="Website.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;" img class="center"></a><br>
<p>My next project, the idea was to develop a choose-your-own-adventure style
  website. Being a fan of mystery books, I chose to create a simple adventure of
   a hungry thief. I used skills like embedding photos and websites into the
   code. I used linking to help you navigate from one part of the adventure to
   the next. This project was fun and challenged my creativity.  </p><br>

      <p>My inspiration for this project came from an article involving the new
         James Webb telescope. With our new advances in science were closer to
         the starts than we have ever been.  To create this animation, I used
         P5.Js. This project was interesting because I could only use code which
          is typically for programming to create something visual. The biggest
          challenge I faced was creating the mouse icon. I did not want to use
          your normal pointer, so I found a Png of an alien ship and replaced
          it. Now the alien will follow you wherever you go.  </p><br>
